I'm a **full-stack developer** looking to work in an established midsize company, ideally with strong ethical ideas, and as part of a diverse team with a flat structure. While I'm open to anything (back or front end focus, in any language) that will allow me to build on what I've learned in the last 16 weeks (see [Education](#education) below), I particularly enjoyed the **Swift / XCode** environment, so any mobile development opportunities would be a big plus. Ultimately I'd like to contribute to things that make a positive difference to people's lives.

After 12 years working in the advertising industry at OgilvyOne for a variety of big clients such as IBM, Amex, Unilever, Ford, Kodak and BP, I came to the realisation that I had been working in an increasingly political and fragile environment and that client service was no longer the fun, creative, strategic prospect it once was. This prompted my desire for a career change, and I spent considerable time researching options. I was looking for a sustainable skill in which I could develop core competency reasonably quickly, enjoy, adapt and grow with for the rest of my working life - coding at Makers Academy has so far proven to tick all of those boxes.

## Skills

#### Embracing and running with new tech

In a business world where Return On Investment is king, clients need to be brave, and companies resourceful and persuasive, to give unproven tech a chance. My relationship with IBM and Wimbledon AELTC was the most fruitful in that respect - we combined to deliver some truly technologically groundbreaking projects, using mobile-powered augmented reality in its infancy to enhance the on-site user experience, and data analytics to predict the results of tennis matches in real time. At Makers, venturing into uncharted territory and embracing new tech was pretty much a way of life:

- Our first ever encounter with **JavaScript** had us complete a basic **Ajax-powered** thermostat app in just a week.
- The following week, a small team of us built an AirBnB clone using **Node.js** and **Express.js**, technologies which are not taught on the course.
- Our final project tackled new, untaught tech, this time in the form of an events-based dating app built on a **Node.js server** and written in **Swift / XCode**.

#### Building and maintaining relationships

Relationships and communication are fundamental to any business, and I believe my experience working on complex tech-heavy projects with multiple stakeholders will serve me well as a developer.

In my previous role as Account Director (client services), I was responsible for leading and bringing together multiple different disciplines to deliver a wide variety of projects to budget, mostly with a significant digital / tech component (e.g. websites, emails, banners, digital OOH). This was a high friction environment that required strong, close relationships both internally and externally to research and understand consumer needs and behaviours, establish corresponding business objectives, interrogate and improve client briefs, write creative briefs, all while recognising, selling in, and protecting the integrity of great (technologically-approved by our CTO of course) creative ideas!

#### Determined finisher

While at OgilvyOne, I won the funding of our CEO and an industry award (NABS Centurion) for my 'Builders Tea' project, a charity that provides a brick in a well in a Malawi village for every brick of Builders Tea bought. The project required me to bring together an internal team of producers, designers and developers to build a PayPal-enabled site that would visually represent donors' contributions in a virtual well. I successfully partnered with a supermarket tea brand who provided the tea at cost, a print production house that provided the packaging and another charity that builds the pumps for the wells. I sold the tea online via the website and at a pop-up stall at Spitalfields Market. More details, including the source code for the (now decommissioned) website, available on request.

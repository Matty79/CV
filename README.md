After 12 years working in the advertising industry for a variety of mostly large clients such as IBM, Amex, SAP, Ford, Kodak and BP at OgilvyOne, I came to the conclusion that I had been working in an increasingly political, volatile and fragile environment and that client service was no longer the creative, strategic, dynamic prospect it once was. This prompted my desire for a career change, and I spent considerable time researching. I was looking for a sustainable skill in which I could build a core competency reasonably quickly, enjoy, adapt and grow with for the rest of my working life - coding at Makers Academy has so far proven to tick all of those boxes.

I'd love to work as a **full-stack developer** in an established midsize company, ideally with strong ethical ideas and as part of a diverse team with a flat structure. While I'm open to anything that will allow me to build on what I've learned in the last 16 weeks (see below), I particularly enjoyed the **Swift / XCode** environment, so any mobile development opportunities would be a big plus. Ultimately I'd like to create things that make a positive difference to people's lives.

## Skills

#### Embracing and running with new tech

In a business world where ROI is king, clients need to be brave, and agencies resourceful and persuasive, to give unproven tech a chance. My relationship with IBM and Wimbledon was the most fruitful in that respect, where we combined to deliver some truly technologically groundbreaking projects, using mobile-powered augmented reality in its infancy to enhance the on-site user experience, and data analytics to predict the results of tennis matches in real time. I believe the same is true when it comes to the understanding and adoption of the ever-changing tech in the developer world. At Makers, venturing into uncharted territory and embracing new tech was pretty much a way of life:

- Our first ever encounter with **Javascript** had us complete a basic **Ajax-powered** thermostat app in just a week.
- A small team of us built an AirBnB clone using **Node.js** and **Express**, technologies which are not taught on the course. Again, we achieved this in one week.
- Our final project tackled new, untaught tech, this time in the form of an events-based dating app built on a **Node.js server** and written in **Swift / XCode**.

#### Building and maintaining relationships

Relationships and communication are fundamental to any business, and I believe my experience working on complex tech-heavy projects with multiple stakeholders will serve me well as a developer...

In my previous role as Account Director (client services), I was responsible for leading and bringing together multiple different disciplines to deliver a wide variety of projects to budget, mostly with a significant digital / tech component (e.g. websites, emails, banners, digital OOH). This was a high friction environment that required strong, close relationships both internally and externally to research and understand consumer needs and behaviours, establish corresponding business objectives, interrogate and improve client briefs, write creative briefs, all while recognising, selling in, and protecting the integrity of great (technologically-approved by our CTO of course) creative ideas!

#### Determined finisher

While at OgilvyOne, I won the funding of our CEO and an industry award (NABS Centurion) for my 'Builders Tea' project, a charity that provides a brick in a well in a Malawi village for every brick of Builders Tea bought. The project required me to bring together an internal team of producers, designers and developers to build a PayPal-enabled site that would visually represent the donors' contributions in a virtual well. I also had to build relationships from scratch with a supermarket tea brand who provided the tea at cost (Make Mine a Builders), a print production house (Potato Print) that provided the packaging and another charity (PumpAid) that builds the pumps. I sold the tea online and at a pop-up stall at Spitalfields Market. More details, including the source code for the (now decommissioned) website, available on request.
